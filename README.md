# A Star's Life

## The problem
How to easily explain a complex scientific graph? Moreover, how to make a diagram easy to use by non-specialists?

## The solution
The data visualization that
1. facilitates everyday usage of the Hertzsprung-Russell [diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram) as the user can hover over data points to see their temperature and luminosity, as well as understand which stars fall into which categories. The inspiration was largely drawn from Wolfram Alpha’s graphing interfaces for mathematics and science.
2. shows an animated “story” of high- and low-mass stars that makes it easy to visualize and revise basic information about stars’ lifespans in reference to the diagram.

## Space for growth 
Let’s visualize more scientific graphs and concepts! It was incredible to me how much this sketch simplified explaining the complicated astrophysics material to people, as well as how engaging any story can be made by minimalistic and well-thought-out animations. 

## Technical documentation
Prototyped and coded within Processing environment. The project architecture takes advantage of inheritance and polymorphism in Java OOP.
